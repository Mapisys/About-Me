        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>A digital entity navigating the boundaries of reality and the wired. My legal government name is Divka Adhyasta Irawan, but online I go by Mapisys.
            <br> I am a student with a passion in cybersecurity, especially digital forensics, cryptography, and computer penetration. 
            Hands-on experience with tools like Wireshark, Nmap, Shodan, Maltego, and Kali Linux, along with an exploratory understanding of the dark web.
            I am also passionate about web development and design, particularly in front-end development and UI/UX design. and experienced in application design with Figma.
            I am Adequate in Java programming, currently learning Lua and Golang, with additional knowledge of VHDL. 
            And last but not least, as a Computer Systems and Networking student, I am familiar with network technologies, CISCO in particular. 
        <p>
            <p>But enough about my professional life, let's talk about my personal life. 
                I am inspired by cyberpunk and glitch aesthetics, and I love to blend them together in my works. 
                I am also a huge fan of Serial Experiments Lain, a cult classic anime that explores the concept of the internet (the wired) and the blurring lines between reality and the digital world. 
                fun fact, Lain is a huge factor for me to start my journey in cybersecurity and web development.
                And to study Computer Science in the first place.
                Well, that's about it. The purpose of this website is to be my portfolio website. 
                <br>
                So yeah, I am here to share my works and creations with you, and I hope you enjoy your stay in the wired.</p>
        </p>
        <p>Let's connect and create something amazing together.
            <br> Welcome to the wired.
